# temperature_system_simulink_model
This repository contains the simulink model of the a temperature control system of a radar measurement device.
The radar measurement device had two freqeuncy converter cavities that required a specific temperature behavior during the steady state to battle the effects of temperature drift. The simulation file allows the user to interact with different parameters of a temperature PID controller to have an overview about the possible effects of any changes in the temperature dynamics of the device.
